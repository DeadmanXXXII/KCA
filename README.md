Here are the steps to reproduce the vulnerability exploit using the scripts 

Steps to Reproduce

1. Set Up Azure Environment:

Log in to the Azure portal.

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create virtual machines and manage resources within your Azure subscription.

Set up a resource group if you donâ€™t have one already.



2. Prepare the Scripts:

Ensure you have the three Python scripts available:

PostCreationScript.py: For running additional scripts after VM creation.

KubeCloudV2Azure.py: For creating a virtual machine.

SearchAndDestroyAzure.py: For deleting files in shared directories.


Make sure the scripts are configured with the correct subscription ID, resource group name, and any other parameters required (e.g., VM name).



3. Run the Post-Creation Script:

Before creating the virtual machine, run noauth.py to set up any additional configurations or scripts that need to be executed after the VM is created:

python noauth.py



4. Create the Virtual Machine:

After running the creation script, run KubeCloudV2Azure.py to breach the virtual machine:

python KubeCloudV2Azure.py

Ensure the VM is web shelled successfully and note its public IP address for later access.



5. Access Shared Directories:

Log into the newly created virtual machine via SSH using the public IP and credentials specified in the script.

Ensure that the shared directories exist and contain files for deletion.



6. Execute the Search and Destroy Script:

From within the VM, run the SearchAndDestroyAzure.py script:

python SearchAndDestroyAzure.py

This script will traverse the specified shared directories and delete all files it encounters.



7. Verification:

Verify that the files have been deleted from the specified shared directories by checking their contents after running the search and destroy script.



8. Document Findings:

Take note of any error messages or unexpected behavior during script execution.

Document the steps taken and any files affected for reporting purposes.


Example Code for Each Script:

By following these steps and using the provided scripts in the correct order, you should be able to reproduce the scenario of creating a VM and deleting files in shared directories. If you need any further modifications or assistance, feel free to ask!
